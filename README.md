# Analysis Report on COVID Clinical Trials Dataset

## 1. Introduction
The analysis aims to understand the structure of the COVID clinical trials dataset by performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The primary objectives include handling missing values, identifying and treating outliers, standardizing categorical values, and deriving insights through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

## 2. Data Cleaning
### 2.1 Loading and Inspecting the Dataset
The dataset was loaded, and an initial inspection revealed its structure, missing values, and data types.

### 2.2 Handling Missing Values
- Columns with excessive missing values (>50%) were removed.
- Missing categorical values were filled with "Unknown."
- Missing numerical values were replaced with their median values.

### 2.3 Identifying and Removing Duplicates
- Duplicate records were detected and removed to ensure data integrity.

### 2.4 Outlier Detection and Treatment
- The Interquartile Range (IQR) method was used to detect outliers.
- Outliers were replaced with the lower and upper bounds defined by IQR.

### 2.5 Standardizing Categorical Values
- Categorical values were standardized to lowercase and stripped of leading/trailing spaces to ensure consistency.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 3.1 Univariate Analysis (Single-Variable Exploration)
- **Summary Statistics:** Mean, median, mode, variance, and skewness were computed for numerical features.
- **Frequency Distributions:** Categorical variables were analyzed for their frequency distribution.
- **Visualization:**
  - Histograms were plotted to visualize distributions.
  - Box plots were used to detect the spread and presence of outliers.

### 3.2 Bivariate Analysis (Two-Variable Exploration)
- **Correlation Matrix:**
  - A heatmap of the correlation matrix was generated to identify relationships between numerical variables.
- **Scatter Plots:**
  - Plotted for pairs of continuous variables to observe trends and relationships.
- **Categorical vs. Numerical Analysis:**
  - Bar plots and violin plots were used to compare categorical and numerical variables.

### 3.3 Multivariate Analysis (Multiple Variables Exploration)
- **Pair Plots:**
  - Pairwise relationships among multiple numerical variables were visualized.
- **Heatmaps:**
  - Correlations among multiple variables were examined through heatmaps.
- **Grouped Comparisons:**
  - Box plots were used to analyze the combined effect of multiple categorical features on a numerical variable.

## 4. Findings and Insights
1. **Data Integrity and Quality**:
   - The dataset contained missing values and duplicates, which were successfully handled.
   - Standardizing categorical values improved consistency.
2. **Statistical Distributions**:
   - Some numerical features exhibited skewness, which might indicate underlying patterns or data collection biases.
   - Outliers were identified and adjusted using IQR.
3. **Relationships and Trends**:
   - The correlation matrix revealed dependencies among numerical variables.
   - Scatter plots indicated positive/negative trends in certain variables.
   - Grouped analysis provided insights into categorical influences on numerical features.

## 5. Conclusion
This analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the COVID clinical trials dataset. Data cleaning ensured a high-quality dataset, while exploratory data analysis highlighted important trends and relationships. These insights can further assist in predictive modeling or deeper domain-specific investigations.
